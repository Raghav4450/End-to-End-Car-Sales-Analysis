- Removed duplicate records
- Checked and handled missing values
- Corrected data types
- Standardized fuel type values

- ## 🧠 Feature Engineering (Excel)
To enhance analysis, new features were created:

- Car_Age: Derived from manufacturing year
- Price_Category: Budget / Mid Range / Luxury
- Mileage_Category: High Mileage / Low Mileage

These features helped in better segmentation and business analysis.
